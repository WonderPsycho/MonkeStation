Here we store 4 images of a character facing the 4 directions, in 96x96 with the character in the center, this is so we have a consistant work image to manipulate for when we make a displacement map.
This may be expanded to various other things in the future so we want to folder these
The images are also already stored in the format to be handled in goons tool.

The easist way to edit these tools would be to use something like Goons Displacement python script. To obtain you would need to join the goon discord.
